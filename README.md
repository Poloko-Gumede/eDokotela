eDokotela App

The app that I would like to develop will include different stacks, but first I will explain what I would like to define what is is I want it to do.

I would like to have this app to let people receive their medication medication at a click of a button from clinics. So an end user would have to have their vitals ready from an accredited health practitioners ready and submit from the app as well as any other info they would like to disclose. The info will be received and processed accordingly and people will have their medication couriered over to them.

I will be using different stacks namely Kotlin as my primary language and some Java as a secondary language. I will also be using APIs for data purposes and for some for the user experience I will also be making use of some UI/UX.

My app will have a a relevant splash screen as well as relevant buttons for end-users to be able to navigate around. I will also include a text-box where any comments will be inserted.

The intended user is for anyone that need to access their medication from a clinic and are also on the move around the country at all times or anyone that is reluctant to go to a clinic because they are scared of attracting COVID-19.

The impact will see a stabilization in the rising number of COVID-19 cases and a decrease in the number of people that fill-up our clinics.
